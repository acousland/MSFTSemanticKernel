 Johnson Applying says, Mr. Dalek, how can I help you? Hi, I recently purchased a Blender for you guys and I just got an email saying that there's a recall on the model because one of the blades are defective, so I want to return it and get a different model. Sure, so I can definitely help you with that. What is your first and last name? Short Steve Simmons. Okay, can you spell that for me? Yes, I have a last name is Simmons, that's I-M-M-O-N-S. Okay, I have Steve, that's I-M-M-O-N-S. Correct. Okay, can I also have your email address? Sure, it's Steve Simmons, just like it's spelled at gmail.com. Okay, I have Steve Simmons, that's I-M-M-O-N-S at gmail.com. Yes. Okay, great. I have located you in our system and you purchased the model number 23087, which has been recalled. I'm going to email you a prepaid shipping label to send back the recalled blender and we will be mailing you our latest model. Well, thank you very much. The problem, Mr. Simmons, can I just have your mailing address? Sure, it's 800 North Henderson Road in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania and the zip is 1946. Okay, I have 800 North Henderson Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, 19406. Correct. And could you tell me how long it's going to take to get the new blender? Sure, you can expect your new blender to arrive in about four to six businesses. Oh, great. Thank you very much. No problem. Is there anything else I could help you with today? No, that's all I needed, but thank you. Thank you. Have a nice day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
